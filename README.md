Zettix.com Game Card Development

This is a utility to quickly develop game cards for do it yourself card games.
It functions as a web utility by composing text, fonts and colors onto a 5x7 card.
The default resolution is 2500 x 3500.

To use it, directly surf to the cgi utility:
/cgi-bin/cardweb.py

Some 40 options are available, including background color, font selection,
the presence of the title, color text, or footer, and border and frame sizes.

Files are output to a /cards directory on the web server and there is no facility to remove them
so periodic cleanup is necessary.
